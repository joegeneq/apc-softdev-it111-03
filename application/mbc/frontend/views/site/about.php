<strong>General Information:</strong>
<p class="box"> 
It all started in the year 1965 when the Foreign Mission Board together with Pasay Baptist Church made a five (5) year mission planâ€¦after which the mission work was entrusted to Village Baptist Church. In 1974, Muntinlupa Baptist Church was finally organized and continued to grow through the years and soon mission points were established. By the grace of God, the church was able to produce a School Ministry; MBC Sinai School and two (2) daughter churches; Lord Epistle Baptist Church in San Pedro, Laguna and Lakeview Baptist Church in Muntinlupa City. To date, Muntinlupa Baptist Church continues to pursue its vision to honor and glorify God through the ministry of witnessing and evangelism reaching the world for Christ.
